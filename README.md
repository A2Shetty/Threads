# Threads

Task: Testing Threads

Instructions: As a QA engineer, your task is to create a test plan, write test cases, and execute them for testing Threads (https://www.threads.net), a popular social media platform recently launched. Similar to Twitter, Threads allows users to post tweets, follow other users, and interact with content through likes, retweets, and comments. The goal of this test plan is to ensure the functionality, usability, and performance of the Threads platform.

Please follow the given guidelines while completing the task:

Test Plan:

Define the scope of testing, including the key functionalities and features to be tested. You can skip the basic ones like login, logout etc. and try to come up with unobvious but important test cases. Identify the testing approach, techniques, and tools to be used. Specify the test environment requirements, including supported browsers and devices. Outline the test execution process, including any necessary setup or prerequisites in Google Docs document.

Test Cases:

Create at least 5 test cases that cover core functionalities of Threads. Each test case should include a description, preconditions, steps, and expected results. Test cases should cover a variety of scenarios, including positive and negative cases, edge cases, and different user interactions.

Implement the test cases using the Cypress framework. Execute the test cases, ensuring they pass and produce the expected results. Capture screenshots or videos of any critical issues encountered during testing. Document any deviations from expected results and provide necessary details for reproduction.

Test Reporting:

Create a test report summarizing the executed test cases, their outcomes, and any issues found. Include screenshots, videos, or logs as supporting evidence. Categorize issues based on their severity and provide recommendations for their resolution. Note: Focus on providing a well-structured test plan, clear test cases, and executing the test cases within the given time frame.

Once you have completed the task, please provide the test plan, test cases, test execution evidence, and test report as a document or presentation for review. You can also submit the code and documentation as a GitHub repository or email the zip.
